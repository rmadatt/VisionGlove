Python code prototype for **VisionGlove** project based on the code you provided. We'll use the `vision_agent` library to implement features like counting the number of people in an image and tracking them in video feeds.

Since VisionGlove is aimed at enhancing personal safety and preventing crime, we'll focus on real-time detection and tracking of people, which can be crucial in identifying potential threats.

---

## **Project Setup**

Firstly, ensure you have the `vision_agent` library installed. If it's not installed yet, you can install it using:

```bash
pip install vision_agent
```

---

## **Code Prototype**

### **1. Counting People in an Image**

Let's start by writing a script that counts the number of people in an image using the `vision_agent` tools.

```python
# Import necessary modules
from vision_agent.agent import VisionAgentCoderV2
from vision_agent.models import AgentMessage
import vision_agent.tools as T
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initialize the VisionAgent
agent = VisionAgentCoderV2(verbose=True)

# Generate code to count the number of people in an image
code_context = agent.generate_code(
    [
        AgentMessage(
            role="user",
            content="Count the number of people in this image",
            media=["people.jpg"]  # Replace with your image file
        )
    ]
)

# Save the generated code to a Python file
with open("count_people.py", "w") as f:
    f.write(code_context.code + "\n" + code_context.test)

# Alternatively, execute the generated code directly
exec(code_context.code)
exec(code_context.test)
```

**Explanation:**

- We initialize the `VisionAgentCoderV2` to generate code based on our request.
- The `AgentMessage` includes the instruction and the image file.
- The generated code is saved to `count_people.py`, or you can execute it directly.

---

### **2. Using the Tools Directly to Count People**

You can also use the `vision_agent.tools` directly without the agent:

```python
import vision_agent.tools as T
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the image
image = T.load_image("people.jpg")  # Replace with your image file

# Detect persons in the image using the object detection tool
detections = T.countgd_object_detection("person", image)

# Get the number of people detected
num_people = len(detections)
print(f"Number of people detected: {num_people}")

# Visualize the bounding boxes on the image
viz = T.overlay_bounding_boxes(image, detections)

# Save the visualization to a file
T.save_image(viz, "people_detected.jpg")

# Display the visualization
plt.imshow(viz)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**

- **Loading the image**: Replace `"people.jpg"` with the path to your image file.
- **Object Detection**: We use `countgd_object_detection` with the class `"person"` to detect people.
- **Visualization**: Bounding boxes are overlaid on detected persons, and the result is saved and displayed.

---

### **3. Tracking People in a Video**

To extend this to video, we can track people across frames.

```python
import vision_agent.tools as T
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load frames and timestamps from the video
frames_and_ts = T.extract_frames_and_timestamps("people.mp4")  # Replace with your video file

# Extract frames
frames = [frame_data["frame"] for frame_data in frames_and_ts]

# Perform tracking on the frames
tracks = T.countgd_sam2_video_tracking("person", frames)

# Visualize tracking results on the frames
viz_frames = T.overlay_segmentation_masks(frames, tracks)

# Save the visualization as a video
T.save_video(viz_frames, "people_tracked.mp4")

# Optionally, display the first frame
plt.imshow(viz_frames[0])
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**

- **Extract Frames**: We extract frames from the video using `extract_frames_and_timestamps`.
- **Tracking**: Use `countgd_sam2_video_tracking` to track persons across frames.
- **Visualization**: Overlay segmentation masks on the frames to visualize tracking results.
- **Saving the Video**: The resulting frames are saved as a new video file.

### **4. Integrating with VisionGlove Hardware**

#### **Assuming VisionGlove has a Camera Module and Haptic Feedback**

Let's write a script that:

- Captures real-time video from the VisionGlove's camera.
- Detects and counts people in real-time.
- Provides haptic feedback if the number of people exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., potential crowding or threat detection).

```python
import vision_agent.tools as T
import cv2
import time

# Initialize video capture (0 for default camera or specify the camera index)
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Threshold for triggering haptic feedback
PERSON_THRESHOLD = 3  # Adjust based on your criteria

# Function to activate haptic feedback
def activate_haptic_feedback():
    # Code to activate haptic devices on the VisionGlove
    # This could be sending a signal to the microcontroller
    print("Haptic feedback activated!")

try:
    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        
        # Detect people in the frame
        detections = T.countgd_object_detection("person", frame)
        num_people = len(detections)
        print(f"People detected: {num_people}")
        
        # Visualize detections
        viz_frame = T.overlay_bounding_boxes(frame, detections)
        
        # Display the frame
        cv2.imshow('VisionGlove Real-Time Detection', viz_frame)
        
        # Check if the number of people exceeds the threshold
        if num_people >= PERSON_THRESHOLD:
            activate_haptic_feedback()
        
        # Exit on pressing 'q'
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

        # Small delay
        time.sleep(0.1)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Interrupted by user")

finally:
    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Explanation:**

- **Video Capture**: Captures video feed from the VisionGlove's camera.
- **Detection**: Performs person detection on each frame.
- **Haptic Feedback**: Activates when the number of detected people exceeds the defined threshold.
- **Visualization**: Displays the video with bounding boxes in a window.
- **Cleanup**: Releases resources on exit.

---

### **5. Haptic Feedback Implementation**

For the `activate_haptic_feedback()` function, you'll need to interface with the microcontroller controlling the haptic actuators on the VisionGlove. Here's a pseudo-code example:

```python
import serial

# Initialize serial communication (adjust 'COM3' and baud rate as necessary)
ser = serial.Serial('COM3', 9600)

def activate_haptic_feedback():
    # Send a command to the microcontroller to activate haptic feedback
    ser.write(b'ACTIVATE_HAPTIC\n')
```

**Explanation:**

- **Serial Communication**: Uses the `pyserial` library to communicate with the microcontroller.
- **Command Protocol**: You need to define a command protocol that the microcontroller understands (e.g., sending a specific string when haptic feedback should be activated).

---

## **Next Steps**

- **Hardware Integration**: Ensure the VisionGlove's sensors, camera, and haptic actuators are properly interfaced with your code.
- **Optimize Performance**: Real-time video processing can be intensive. Consider optimizing the detection algorithms or using more efficient models.
- **Enhance Detection**: Implement more sophisticated threat assessment, such as recognizing suspicious behaviors or objects.
- **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface or alerts system, possibly integrating with a mobile app.

---

## **Additional Considerations**

- **Ethical Use**: Always ensure that the use of camera and detection systems complies with privacy laws and ethical guidelines.
- **Testing**: Rigorously test the system in various environments to validate its reliability and accuracy.
- **Documentation**: Document your code and hardware configurations thoroughly for maintenance and potential collaboration.

---

## **Conclusion**

This prototype provides a solid foundation for the VisionGlove's core functionality of detecting and responding to potential threats. By leveraging the `vision_agent` tools and integrating with your hardware, you can expand upon this code to create a robust and innovative solution.
